Hello, my name is Kavin Mohan. My insta account is @kavinm0han, my snapchat is @ihavenoname00 (sorry, I made the name very early but I never used it since last year) and my discord is BlazedFir#6768. I got a  medal for some races in cross country, I volunteered for youth council for around 30 hours last year, focusing on special education, and me and the rest of our quizbowl club have qualified 2 teams for the national tournament this year.
